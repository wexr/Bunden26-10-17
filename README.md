# My First Mandatory assigntment @ EASJ NÃ¦stved <br /> (Computer Science)
The assigtment was to create 4 classes:
1. Studerende: This class should contain some class variables, contructors and class methods that describes the computer science students on my team.
2. DatHoldet: Create my self and some of my class mates as objects of the type Studerende.
3. Start: Should contain the main() method which brings in the other 3 classes.
4. MineMetoder: Should contain atleast 5 things that illustrates what I have learned. Comment my understanding of the code.

I made the main part of this program using a while loop, that makes the user type in menu choices to move around.
<br />With each input, the user is prompted with new options.
<br/>The program continuous to run until the user types in the proper end command.
